### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a fullstack web/software **developer** from Spain, versatile with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies.

- ðŸ”­ I'm working on apps in **React**, **JavaScript**, **C#**, **.NET**.
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning **Software Architecture**, decision making and thought process to gain wider and abstract knowledge of coding.

- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my personal coding projects in my free time. I also often tinker with various gadgets, build bots, create scrapers, or develop tools for my day-to-day needs.
  - [Animal Browsing](https://github.com/sbellodev/animalbrowsing) - Website that shows lists and info about items of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
  - [Michiapp](https://github.com/sbellodev/michiapp) - Website tinder-like to meet and know other pet-owners.
  - [Finance bot](https://github.com/sbellodev/finbot) - Telegram bot that alerts when to buy or sell.
  - [Tweet API Scraper](https://github.com/sbellodev/tweetapi) - Python script that scraps someone tweets and saves into a file.
  - [Blog](https://github.com/sbellodev/blog) - Blog made in Jekyll, where I track whatever issues or questions I get a lot of times.
  
- âš¡ When I'm not coding, I indulge my passion for mathematics, design, and reading as hobbies.
